# 2. A Random Password Generator
This project implements a Random Password Generator using Python. The generator creates secure, random passwords with customizable lengths and character sets. The generated passwords are designed to be secure and difficult to guess, which can be used for securing user accounts or sensitive data.


# Technologies Used :
1. Pyhton
The primary programming language for the project. Python is chosen due to its simplicity, ease of use, and the availability of libraries for generating random strings.
2. random module
A built-in Python module used for generating random numbers and selecting random characters from predefined sets. This is essential for ensuring the randomness of the generated passwords.
3. string module
A Python standard library that provides a set of string constants like ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation characters, which are used to form the pool of characters for the password.



# Features :
Customizable Password Length,
Character Set Options,
Randomness,
Secure Passwords.
